1) Erik was heading to the Flughafen to find the best brot
2) He heard the best brots were in Berlin
3) However, all of the brots were sold out, so he went back to the Hauptstrasse.
4) So I went with my homies to the biergarten.
5) So we all hopped in the bmw and headed out.
6) Meanwhile, a hund wearing lederhose was lurking in the backseat.
7) Isaias ran into Erik and told him a story about how he accidentally bought Lederhose
8) Erik wasn't interested in Isaias story so he jumped into a Porsche.
9) But he drove off too fast and ran over a Mehlhase.
10) It was unfortunate that the Dirndel was much faster and it was too late for Erik to flee.
11) It was dark outside the air was thin, the smell was that of apples on a lone saturday. As Erik Flee he could hear the sound of the hunds looking for him. 
12) Then the welt bewerbsfaehig hund from Berlin exited the BMW.
13) The hund exclaimed "Did you just leave from the biergarten, in a Porche rather than the BMW?".
